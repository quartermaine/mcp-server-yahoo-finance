## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:
1. **pipx**: A tool to install Python applications in isolated environments.
2. **uv**: A fast Python package and environment manager.

### Steps to Install

#### 1. Install pipx
Update your package list and install [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/#on-linux):
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install pipx
pipx ensurepath
```

#### 2. Install uv
Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) using the official installation script:
```bash
wget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
After running the above command, make sure to source the environment variables by running:
```bash
source $HOME/.local/bin/env
```

#### 3. Create a Project and Environment
Create a new project directory:
```bash
mkdir mcp-client
cd mcp-client
```

Create a virtual environment using `uv`:
```bash
uv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install required dependencies:
```bash
uv add fastapi jinja2 uvicorn mcp anthropic python-dotenv openai yfinance
```


## Docker Setup 

To build and run the application using Docker, follow these steps: 

1. **Build the Docker Image**:

Use the docker build command to create a Docker image. Replace <tag_name> with a name of your choice (e.g., mcp-finance): 

```bash
docker build -t <tag_name> .
```
Example: 
```bash
docker build -t mcp-finance .
```

2. **Run the Docker Container** :

Use the docker run command to start the container. Map port 8000 on your host machine to port 8000 in the container: 

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 <tag_name>
```
Example: 
```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 mcp-finance
```

3. **Access the UI** :

After running the container, navigate to the URL printed in the terminal logs (e.g., http://0.0.0.0:8000) to access the web-based 

## Usage

### Running the Server

To run the Yahoo Finance MCP server, execute the following command in one terminal with the activated environment:
```bash
uv run yahoo_finance.py
```

### Running the UI
In another terminal with the activated environment, start the FastAPI app (UI) using Uvicorn: 
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

After running this command, Uvicorn will print a log message with the URL where the app is running, typically:
```
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Open the provided link (http://127.0.0.1:8000) in your browser to access the UI built with DaisyUI components 

## Environment Configuration

This project uses **Azure OpenAI** as the Language Model (LLM) provider. To configure the necessary parameters, follow these steps:

1. **Create a `.env` File**:
   Copy the `.env.example` file to create a `.env` file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Set Azure OpenAI Parameters**:
   Open the `.env` file and set the following environment variables:
   ```env
   AZURE_OPEN_AI_API_VERSION=<your_api_version>
   AZURE_OPEN_AI_ENDPOINT=<your_endpoint>
   AZURE_OPEN_AI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
   AZURE_OPEN_AI_DEPLOYMENT_MODEL=<your_deployment_model>
   ```

   Replace `<your_api_version>`, `<your_endpoint>`, `<your_api_key>`, and `<your_deployment_model>` with your actual Azure OpenAI credentials.

3. **Verify the `.env` File**:
   Ensure the `.env` file is correctly formatted and contains all required parameters. Example:
   ```env
   AZURE_OPEN_AI_API_VERSION=2023-05-15
   AZURE_OPEN_AI_ENDPOINT=https://<your-resource-name>.openai.azure.com/
   AZURE_OPEN_AI_API_KEY=12345abcdef67890ghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
   AZURE_OPEN_AI_DEPLOYMENT_MODEL=gpt-4
   ```

4. **Load Environment Variables**:
   The `python-dotenv` library automatically loads the `.env` file when running the server or client. Ensure the `.env` file is located in the root directory of your project.


## Integrating with Github Copilot

To integrate the MCP Yahoo Finance Server with GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps: 
 
1. **Create a start-mcp.sh script** 

Create a shell script named start-mcp.sh to activate the virtual environment and start the server. Add the following content to the file: 

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Navigate to the project directory
cd /<path_to>/mcp-server-yahoo-finance || { echo "Directory not found"; exit 1; }

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate || { echo "Failed to activate virtual environment"; exit 1; }

# Run the server
uv run yahoo_finance.py || { echo "Failed to start server"; exit 1; }

```

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x /<path_to>/start_mcp.sh
```

2. **Configure .vscode/mcp.json** 

Create a .vscode/mcp.json file in the root of your project directory with the following content:

```bash
{
    "servers": {
        "my-mcp-server": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "/<path_to>/start-mcp.sh",
            "args": []
        }
    }
}
```

This configuration tells VS Code to use the start-mcp.sh script to start the MCP server.

3. **Add the MCP Server to GitHub Copilot** 

To add the the server to your copilot and use the tools in mcp server

- Open Copilot in Visual Studio Code.
- Swith to Agent mode in Chat view
- Select Tools button to view the tools

see more in the official [site](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_add-an-mcp-server-to-your-user-settings)

## TODO

- **Enhance Error Handling**:
  - Provide more descriptive error messages for invalid inputs or failed API calls.

- **Add Support for Additional APIs**:
  - Integrate other financial APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Finnhub) for broader data coverage.

- **Optimize Performance**:
  - Cache frequently requested data to reduce API calls and improve response times.

- **Documentation**:
  - Add detailed API documentation for developers who want to extend the functionality.
